# Problemn 1
# There exists a reality in which the following entities exists:
#
# 1. A commercial land (L) exists.
# 2. The land is owned by a seller (S).
# 3. A buyer (B-1) is interested in purchasing L.
# 4. At time (T-1), B-1 and S reach an agreement.
# 5. They agree to a contract (C-1) in which:
#   - B-1 will pay the price of $100,000 (P) for L whch goes to S
#   - S agrees to sell L L to B-1, represents they have the authority, etc to complete this transaction, will provide 90 days for B-1 to confirm promises are true
#   - In return for the right to purchase L and having 90 days (ED = exectution date) to conduct due diligence (DD) to validate promises pays $15,000 of the purchase price as a deposit (D)
#   - If B-1 does not fulfil their portion of C-1, S is entitled to D for the option value of C-1
#   - S will provide B-1 with information and any additional assistance required by B-1's DD team to be able to close by ED
# 6. At some point (T-2), a new buyer B-2 offers S $110,000 for L
# 7. Interested in the extra money, S agrees to sell L to B-2 instead of B-1
# 8. S ignores C-1 and instead enters C-2 with B-2 to earn the additional $10,000
# 9. In 80 days (T-3), S and B-2 complete C-2 and transfer assets\
# 10. B-1 discovers this situation.
# 11. After investing capital in DD on the property, B-1 believes C-2 violates C-1 and entitles them to somoe remedy.
# 12. S disagrees with B-1 and refuses to provide concessions or compensation for proceeding with C-2 instead of C-1
# 13. B-1 sues S and B-2 to have fairness experts evaluate the situation
e
# Problem 2
# The parties involved view the situation from diametrically opposite perspectives. There exists an invariant value for this transaction such that all parties can be considered no
# better or worse off if C-1 or C-2 had occurred. In short, there is some unchanging equation that provided a set of values as inputs returns an output that it is
# provably accurate regardless of one's position.
#
# INPUT (Givens, Knowns, Data)
# - Question: What framework guarantees entities regardless of which contract is executed are in a neutral position?
# - Entities
#   - Parties: S, B-1, B-2
#    - Contracts: C-1, C-2
#    - Deposits: D-1 = $15,000 paid for the contract by B-1, and an assumed $15,000 by B-2
#    - Land: L = L-1 value = $100,000 with B-1 and L-2 = $110,000 with B-2
#    - Cash: B-1 cash = $100,000, B-2 cash = $110,000
#    - Time: T-1 = C-1 agreement, T-2 time B-2 makes offer to S, T-3 = time when S and B-2 complete C-2, T-4 = time when C-1 was to be completed,
#       - T-5 = time when legal proceedings are expected to be done = 1.5 years
#    - Attorney's: A-1 for B-1 and A-2 for S and A-3 for B-2, etc
#    - Infrastructure (I): I-1, 2, etc representing courts, experts, and other costs from other systems needed to corret this failed system of this contract C-1
#    - Opportuniyty Costs (OC): Lost value from this process
#    - Penalty Costs (PC): Value necessary to disincentivize this behavior such that the business process operates as efficiently as possible without intervention
# - Rules:
#    - For business to function, there must be reasonable certainty that agreements between parties will largely result in expectations meeting actual results
#    - When expectations and actual results differ, corrective action is required to ensure business agreements continue to have value going forward
#    - If behavior by one, multiple, or all parties is found to be counter to achieving the above, each accountable party must be allocated their fair share of the cost calculated
#
# OUTPUT
# - Amount: a value of the difference in value between the completion of C-1 and C-2
# - Attribution: a ratio of allocation to each party in the transaction
# - Direction: a - represents an amount owed from a party and a + represents and amount owed to a party
#
# PRECONDITIONS
# - Reasonable expectation that C-1 was going to complete as planned
# - C-2 can reasonably be viewed the primary reason for C-1 not proceeding as expected
# - One or more parties received unfair value as a result of C-2 occuring instead of C-1
# - All contracts meet the minimum criteria necessary to be considered contracts
# - Parties agree to operate in good faith to reach a fair resolution
#
# POSTCONDITIONS
# - All parties at the end of this process should be at a neutral position to where they would have been if C-1 had proceeded as expected
# - Precision and rigor of operations ensures it is the most accurate as bojective experts would argue approach to quantifying this situation
# - Additional costs of this process and other additional costs are allocated pro rata to party(ies) found accountable for any differnce between expected value
#   - each party would have at the final time this process is expected to be done
#
# EQUATIONS
# - S Value in C-2 (SV-2) - S Value in C-1 (SV-1) + B-1 Value in C-2 (B-1V-2) - B-1 Value in C-1 (B-1V-1) + B-2 Value in C-2 (B-2V-2) - B-2 in C-1 (B-2V-1) = 0
# - This is a 0-sum system such that a gain to one or more parties = an equal loss to one or more others
# - There exists some scalar values representing the difference between C-2 and C-1 to parties
# - There exists some continuous value at which teh scalar value changes over time for output when everything is done - expected output in C-1 = 0 once adjusted for additional costs of this process
#
